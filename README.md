This repository contains the code and documentation for my Bachelor Project. The project focuses on monocular depth estimation and object detection and recognition to achieve real-time 3D scene understanding and object localization.

## Project Structure
- `code/`: Contains the implementation code for the project, including depth estimation, object detection, and segmentation algorithms.
- `report/`: Contains the practical report files, such as its PDF and things such as Gantt charts and images for the project.
